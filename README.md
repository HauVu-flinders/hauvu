###I'm an Apprentice Developer

--🔭 I’m currently building a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience for user
--🌱 I’m teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and web development
💻 I have some small projects in my public repositories, let's check it out
🥅 2023 Goal: Get my very first job as a software developer 🙏
⚡ Fun fact: I studied public health in Vietnam, I moved to Australia to work as barista to save money to study in Australia, now I'm studying Master of IT at Flinders University. I am passionate about software development so I've been spending a lot of time teaching myself programming skills. Also, I'm proud to be an apprentice software developer of Udacity 😁
